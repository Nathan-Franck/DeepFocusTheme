## Deep Focus Theme

A theme maximizing control flow and data awareness.

*Generally I want to be able to see broadly where my data is going and what my program is doing in stark relief, and if I want to learn more about the particulars of variable types, or where things come from, I will focus more narrowly to read all the text. The most colorful eye-catching element should be my cursor and changes, not the text!*

Important:
* control flow keywords
* functions/methods
* fields
* variables

Unimportant:
* types
* namespaces
* comments
* line numbers

Source code is provided if you want to make your own flavor!
